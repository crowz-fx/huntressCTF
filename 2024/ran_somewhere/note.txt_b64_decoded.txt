Hey There! You should be more careful next time and not leave your computer unlocked and unattended! You never know what might happen. Well in this case, you lost your flash drive. Don't worry, I will keep it safe and sound. Actually you could say it is now 'fortified'. You can come retrieve it, but you got to find it. I left a couple of files that should help.
