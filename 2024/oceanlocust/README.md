# OceanLocust

Note - you can chose between debug and release, I went debug as i have no clue what I'm doing

## Steps

```bash
wget https://huntress.ctf.games/files/e9f6924d1a10cce4ca82f649b737c8c9/ocean_locust.7z
7z x ocean_locust.7z

# run strings
strings png-challenge-debug.exe > png-challenge-debug.exe_strings

# see that it's a rust app, go through output and see it does some things like random etc.

# will need to decompile to complete, will come back
```

## Flag

```
